    <h1>Evolution</h1>

      <p><strong>Evolution</strong> is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over <emphasis>successive generations</emphasis>. Evolutionary processes give rise to biodiversity at every level of biological organisation, including the levels of species, individual organisms, and molecules</p>

      <p>All life on Earth shares a common ancestor known as the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), which lived approximately 3.5â€“3.8 billion years ago, although a study in 2015 found "remains of biotic life" from 4.1 billion years ago in ancient rocks in Western Australia. In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the LUCA of all organisms living on Earth.</p>
